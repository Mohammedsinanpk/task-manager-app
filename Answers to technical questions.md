### How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately 12 hours on the coding test. This includes setting up the project, implementing core functionality, styling the UI, handling state management, debugging, and adding additional features like filtering, sorting, and search functionality.

### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Tracking performance issues in production requires a combination of monitoring, profiling, and debugging tools. The steps I would follow include:
Use Browser Developer Tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Profiler) – Check network requests, JavaScript execution time, and rendering bottlenecks.

### If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

Given more time, I would enhance the application with the following features:
Drag-and-Drop Task Reordering – Allow users to rearrange tasks using libraries like react-beautiful-dnd.
Recurring Tasks – Add the ability to set tasks to repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.
Notifications & Reminders – Send browser or email notifications for upcoming and overdue tasks.
